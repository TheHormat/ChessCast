# 🛡 ChessCast Security Policy

## **🚀 Reporting Security Issues**
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** disclose it publicly. Instead, report it privately to our security team via **[thehormat@gmail.com]**. We take security issues seriously and will investigate and resolve them as quickly as possible.

### **⚡ Security Response Process:**
1. **Report the issue** via email with a clear description and proof of concept (if applicable).
2. Our team will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.
3. We will investigate and provide a status update within **7 business days**.
4. If a patch is required, we will issue an update and notify responsible parties.
5. We appreciate responsible disclosure and may acknowledge contributors who report valid vulnerabilities.

## **🛡 Security Best Practices for Developers**
To ensure ChessCast remains secure and reliable, developers should adhere to the following security measures:

### 🔑 **1. Secure API Keys & Tokens**
- Never expose **API keys** (e.g., Telegram Bot Token, database credentials) in your code.
- Use **environment variables** (`.env`) to store sensitive data.
- **Example:** Instead of hardcoding:
  ```python
  BOT_TOKEN = "your-secret-token"
  ```
  Store it securely using:
  ```python
  import os
  BOT_TOKEN = os.getenv("BOT_TOKEN")
  ```

### 🔒 **2. Enforce Least Privilege Access**
- Limit database and API access permissions to **only what is necessary**.
- Avoid using admin credentials for general-purpose operations.

### 🔧 **3. Regularly Update Dependencies**
- Keep all libraries and dependencies **up to date** to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Run:
  ```bash
  poetry update
  ```

### 🔐 **4. Use Secure Authentication Methods**
- Implement **OAuth2**, JWT, or API key authentication for external integrations.
- Enforce strong password policies for users.
